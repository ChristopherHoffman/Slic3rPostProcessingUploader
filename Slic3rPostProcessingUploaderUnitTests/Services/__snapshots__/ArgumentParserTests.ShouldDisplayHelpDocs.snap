Usage: In the Slicer's 'Post-Processing Scripts' section, add the path to this file
Slic3rPostProcessingUploader.exe [options]

Options:
--help, -h: Display this help message. No settings will be uploaded if help is displayed.
--local-dev: Use the local development environment
--debug <path>: Save debug information to the specified path
--opt-out-telemetry: Disable telemetry tracking. To help improve the plugin, we track slicer and plugin versions, as well as log errors that are thrown. No personal data is collected.

Note Template Options:
  --default: Use the default note template, which contains a curated list of general settings. Preferred by most users. The Default template is used if no other note template option is given.
  --full: Use the full note template, which lists most of the settings available in the slicers
  --template <path>: Use a custom note template. Absolute paths work better. See README for more details on syntax

Example: Slic3rPostProcessingUploader --default --debug C:\debug\
